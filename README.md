This will be what the first part will look  like once the Java code is run.

You will first need to open a file to be able to activate and check the analyses.

<br>
Once a file is selected-- recommended to be a text file that contains variable declaration in Java-- it will show in the text-area.

<br>
As you can see, once you click on the Lexical Analysis, it will show the data types of each words/characters it will see that is separated by spaces.

<br>
For this part, it shows that the semantic analysis is correct and so the semantic analysis is activated.

<br>
In this part, the semantic analysis also passed. You can clear the text-area to add a new one or exit the app.

<br>
I cleared the text-area and added a file that contains the same variable declaration. This time, I purposely did not a semi-colon in the end.

<br>
It still went through the lexical analysis since it's purpose is to just name the tokens.

<br>
FOr this last part, it threw an error because of the missing semi-colon. Without the semi-colon, the java compiler or interpreter cannot correctly parse the end of a statement, leading to syntax errors.
